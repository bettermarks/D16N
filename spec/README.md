You may find it useful to [install][adoc-install] `asciidoctor` to build locally.

Unless the world has changed, it's likely a case of
- `brew install asciidoctor` on macOS
- `sudo apt-get install asciidoctor` on Ubuntu or
- `nix-shell -p asciidoctor` on NixOS

There's probably also a preview extension for your editor.
